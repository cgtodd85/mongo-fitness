## Description

Research shows that a person will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress. I wanted to create a simple and easy to use app to track your workouts over time.

## Installation

Fork this repo and clone to your machine. Run npm i in the main directory to install the dependencies. Run npm start to start the local server. Default port is set in server.js but you can change that.

## Usage

You can run npm run reed in the previous steps to populate the app with data so you can see what the final result may look like. Otherwise click new workout and enter the fields as directed. You can continue adding different exercise types to the same workout or input a new workout. Click on dashboard to see your stats.
